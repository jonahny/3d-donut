# 3D Donut website

This is a tutorial for creating a website with a 3D donut on it (made by Leo in Blender). Follow the steps below.

1. Create an index.html, the page should meet the following requirements:
   - Have `!DOCTYPE` tag
   - Have `html` tag
   - Have `head` tag inside of `html` tag
   - Have `body` tag inside of `html` tag
2. Have the `title` of the tab/window say "Donut Visualizer"
3. Create a `p`aragraph tag inside the `body`. The paragraph should contain a description of the project.
4. Host the site on GitHub Pages using [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).
5. Embed the `<script>` tag for `model-viewer`. The documentation for doing so found [here](https://modelviewer.dev/).
6. Create a `<model-viewer>` tag (continuing to follow the previous step's documentation) that links to the `donut.glb`.`
   - The `<model-viewer>` will not work locally so you'll have to push up your changes in a commit to the GitHub Pages site that you created.
